# High-Level Summary
# This script is designed to process sleep study data, including signal data from a .edf file and annotations from a .csv file. It loads the signal data, preprocesses the annotations, and then vectorizes various types of events (respiratory events, sleep stages, arousals, and limb movements) to facilitate further analysis.

    """
    Load an EDF signal file together with its annotation CSV, preprocess the
    annotations so they align with the signal, and optionally vectorize the
    main event types.

    Parameters
    ----------
    path_signal : str | pathlib.Path
        Path to the `.edf` polysomnography file.
    path_annotations : str | pathlib.Path
        Path to the annotations `.csv`.
    vectorize : bool, default True
        If True, vectorize the main event types into a single DataFrame with
        columns for each event type. The columns are named as follows:
        `stage` (sleep stages), `arousal` (arousals), `resp` (respiratory events),
        and `limb` (limb movements). If False, return the
        cleaned annotations DataFrame as is. 

    Returns
    -------
    signal : pandas.DataFrame
        Raw signal channels, shape = (samples Ã— channels).
    annotations : pandas.DataFrame
        Cleaned, time-aligned annotations (if vectorize is True), else the cleaned up full annotations array.
    fs_original : float
        Original sampling frequency (Hz) of the loaded signal.
